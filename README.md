# coding-exercices
As an IT student I will use the place to store my Design Patterns implementation, my coding katas or any coding exercises that might be of interest (to me). Feel free to dig in, remember that it might not be clean or optimized though. The main objective being to improve my coding skills, don't hesitate to comment or DM me about mistakes or malpractice that I might have done (or to propose a refactoring).
